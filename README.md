# Mini Bank App (.NET Core/CRUD/jQuery/AJAX)
This is a simply application. Here with jQuery Ajax I develop an HTTP request to controller action methods without reloading the entire page. This allows us to only re-render a portion of the application, which gives more performance and smaller bandwidth usage, similar to a single page application created with front-end frameworks like Angular or React.

* Form design for insert and update operation.
* Display forms in modal popup dialog.
* Form post using jQuery Ajax.
* Implement MVC CRUD operations with jQuery Ajax.
* Loading spinner in .NET Core MVC.
* Prevent direct access to MVC action method.
